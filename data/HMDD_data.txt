5925	hsa-mir-155	Breast Neoplasms	21946536	Mechanistically, we found that BRCA1 epigenetically represses miR-155 expression via its association with HDAC2, which deacetylates histones H2A and H3 on the miR-155 promoter. We show that overexpression of miR-155 accelerates but the knockdown of miR-155 attenuates the growth of tumor cell lines in vivo. Our findings demonstrate a new mode of tumor suppression by BRCA1 and suggest that miR-155 is a potential therapeutic target for BRCA1-deficient tumors.

High miRNA-21 expression was correlated with a worse prognosis in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (P=0.045). The immunohistochemical expression patterns of PDCD4 (reduced nuclear staining pattern) and TIMP3 (downregulated expression) were significantly associated with both the upregulated miR-21 expression (P<0.05) and the poor survival of the patients (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). Our data suggest that an overexpression of miRNA-21 is, therefore, associated with the biological behavior of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via the downregulation of the expression of tumor suppressors, PDCD4 and TIMP3, thus resulting in tumor progression and the adverse clinical course of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
6085	hsa-mir-1293	Sarcoma, Kaposi	21984125	We show a direct repression of vIL-6 by hsa-miR-1293 and hIL-6 by hsa-miR-608. The repression of vIL-6 by miR-1293 was reversed by disruption of the vIL-6 miR-1293 seed match through the introduction of point mutations. In addition, expression of vIL-6 or hIL-6 in KSHV-infected cells could be enhanced by transfection of the respective miRNA inhibitors. In situ hybridization of human lymph node sections revealed that miR-1293 is primarily expressed in the germinal centre but is deficient in the mantle zone of lymph nodes, where the expression of vIL-6 is often found in patients with KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease, providing evidence of an anatomical correlation.

6254	hsa-mir-200c	Endometrial Neoplasms	22015043	We found that miR-200c expression was increased in endometrial carcinoma compared with normal endometrial tissues. Anti-miR or pre-miR-200c could regulate cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis and affect cytotoxicity in endometrial cancer cells. Through mRNA microarray analysis, we found that miR-200c inhibits the expression of BRD7, which was recently reported as a potential tumor suppressor gene. MiR-200c regulated the translocation of β-catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via inhibition of BRD7, resulting in increased expression of its transcriptional target genes, cyclinD1 and c-myc.

6280	hsa-mir-155	Lung Neoplasms	22027557	Hypoxic conditions induce miR-155 expression in lung cancer cells and trigger a corresponding decrease in a validated target, FOXO3A. Furthermore, we find that increased levels of miR-155 radioprotects lung cancer cells, while inhibition of miR-155 radiosensitizes these cells. Moreover, we reveal a therapeutically important link between miR-155 expression, hypoxia, and irradiation by demonstrating that anti-miR-155 molecules also sensitize hypoxic lung cancer cells to irradiation. Our study helps explain how miR-155 becomes elevated in lung cancers, which contain extensive hypoxic microenvironments, and demonstrates that inhibition of miR-155 may have important therapeutic potential as a means to radiosensitize hypoxic lung cancer cells.

6391	hsa-mir-423	Colorectal Neoplasms	22028396	Two SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival of the patients. The most significant SNP was rs6505162 in pre-miR-423. Compared to the homozygous wild-type genotype, the variant-containing genotypes of this SNP were significantly associated with both the overall survival (HR=2.12, 95% CI1.34--3.34, P=0.001) and the recurrence-free survival (HR=1.59, 95% CI1.08--2.36, P=0.019). Another SNP, rs4919510 in pre-miR-608, was also associated with altered recurrence-free survival (HR=0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.92, P=0.017). These effects were evident only in patients receiving chemotherapy but not in those without chemotherapy. In addition, the combined analysis of the two SNPs conferred a 2.84-fold (95% CI 1.50-5.37, P=0.001) increased risk of recurrence and/or death. Similarly, this effect was only prominent in those receiving chemotherapy (P<0.001) but not in those without chemotherapy (P=0.999).

6393	hsa-mir-375	Head and Neck Neoplasms	22031094	MiR-375 expression was significantly reduced (p=0.01), and conversely, MTDH was significantly increased (p=0.0001) in NPC samples. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blots and luciferase assays corroborated MTDH as a target of miR-375. Re-expression of miR-375 and siRNA knock-down of MTDH both decreased cell viability and clonogenic survival, cell migration/invasion, as well as in vivo tumour formation. NPC patients whose tumours expressed high levels of MTDH experienced significantly lower survival, and in particular, higher distant relapse rates (5-year distant relapse rates: 26% vs. 5%; p=0.005).

6490	hsa-mir-433	Ovarian Neoplasms	22069160	MAD2 protein expression levels were downregulated in pre-miR-433 transfected A2780 cells. Secondly, Pre-miR-433 suppressed the activity of a reporter construct containing the 3'-UTR of MAD2. Thirdly, blocking miR-433 binding to the MAD2 3'UTR protected MAD2 from miR-433 induced protein downregulation. Importantly, reduced MAD2 protein expression in pre-miR-433 transfected A2780 cells rendered these cells less sensitive to paclitaxel. In conclusion, loss of MAD2 protein expression results in increased resistance to paclitaxel in EOC cells.

The SET8 CC genotype was independently associated with longer post-operative survival in HCC patients by multivariate analysis (relative risk, 0.175; 95% CI, 0.053 - 0.577; p = 0.004). The SET8 CC genotype was associated with reduced SET8 protein levels based on the immunostaining of 51 HCC tissue samples. We also found the low SET8 levels was associated with longer HCC survival. Our data suggest that SET8 modifies HCC outcome by altering its expression, which depends, at least in part, on its binding affinity with miR502.

6607	hsa-mir-145	Glioblastoma	22098779	The expression of miR145 (a tumor-suppressive miRNA) is inversely correlated with the levels of Oct4 and Sox2 in GBM-CD133(+) cells and malignant glioma specimens.miR145 negatively regulates GBM tumorigenesis by targeting Oct4 and Sox2 in GBM-CD133(+). Using polyurethane-short branch polyethylenimine (PU-PEI) as a therapeutic-delivery vehicle, PU-PEI-mediated miR145 delivery to GBM-CD133(+) significantly inhibited their tumorigenic and CSC-like abilities and facilitated their differentiation into CD133(-)-non-CSCs. Furthermore, PU-PEI-miR145-treated GBM-CD133(+) effectively suppressed the expression of drug-resistance and anti-apoptotic genes and increased the sensitivity of the cells to radiation and temozolomide. Finally, the in vivo delivery of PU-PEI-miR145 alone significantly suppressed tumorigenesis with stemness, and synergistically improved the survival rate when used in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide in orthotopic GBM-CD133(+)-transplanted immunocompromised mice. Therefore, PU-PEI-miR145 is a novel therapeutic approach for malignant brain tumors.

6627	hsa-mir-200c	Breast Neoplasms	22101791	Down-regulation of microRNA-200c is associated with drug resistance in human breast cancer.Down-regulated miR-200c was observed in non-responders as compared to responders. In addition, miR-200c expression was observed to be down-regulated over 800-fold in human breast cancer cells resistant to doxorubicin MCF-7/ADR as compared to the parental MCF-7 cells. Up-regulation of miR-200c with transfection of miR-200c mimics in breast cancer cells could enhance the chemosensitivity to epirubicin and reduce expression of multidrug resistance 1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein. Moreover, our study demonstrated that restoration of miR-200c in MCF-7/ADR cells could increase intracellular doxorubicin accumulation determined by flow cytometry.

6633	hsa-mir-155	Breast Neoplasms	22105810	The relative expression of miR-155 was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in corresponding nontumor tissues. High miR-155 expression was correlated with higher tumor grade, advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis (P?=?0.012, 0.001, and 0.003, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the disease-free and overall survival rates of high miR-155 group were significantly lower than those of low miR-155 group (P?=?0.038 and 0.029, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that high miR-155 expression was a poor prognostic factor (P?=?0.009). Furthermore, antisense targeting miR-155 could inhibit growth, induce cell arrest in G(0) /G(1) phase, enhance apoptosis, and increase radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells.

AA genotype carriers were associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer compared with GG genotype (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-3.15, P = 0.029). Moreover, the gastric cancer risk especially elevated in older individuals (aged >60 years), males, nonsmokers, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-infected individuals (adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.38-5.13, P = 0.004; adjusted OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.27, P = 0.022; adjusted OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, P = 0.018; adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.08-3.10, P = 0.024, respectively).

6726	hsa-mir-34b	Breast Neoplasms	22113133	In this study, we identified one such estrogen down-regulated microRNA, miR-34b, as an onco-suppressor that targets cyclin D1 and JAG-1 (jagged 1) in a ER-positive/wild-type p53 breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) as well as in ovarian and endometrial cells, but not in ER-negative or mutant p53 breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MBA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-435). There is a negative association between ER and miR-34b expression levels in ER-positive breast cancer patients. Tet-on induction of miR-34b can cause inhibition of tumor growth and cell proliferation. Also, the overexpression of miR-34b inhibited ER-positive breast tumor growth in an orthotropic mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. Further validations indicated that estrogen inhibition of miR-34b expression was mediated by interactions between ER and p53, not by DNA methylation regulation. The xenoestrogens diethylstilbestrol and zeranol also showed similar estrogenic effects by inhibiting miR-34b expression and by restoring the protein levels of miR-34b targets, cyclin D1 and JAG-1, in MCF-7 cells.
6727	hsa-mir-629	Lung Neoplasms	22114071	The rs2735383CC (NBS1 gene) genotype had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer under a recessive genetic model in the total 1559 cases versus 1679 controls (OR = 1.40, 95% C.I. = 1.18-1.66, P = 0.0001) when compared with GG or GC genotypes; the rs2735383CC genotype carriers had lower mRNA and protein expression levels in tumor tissues than those of other genotypes as qPCR and western blot shown. Luciferase assay revealed that the rs2735383C allele had a lower transcription activity than G allele; and the hsa-miR-629 but not hsa-miR-499-5P had effect on modulation of NBS1 gene in vitro. We further observed that the X-ray radiation induced more chromatid breaks in lymphocyte cells from the carriers of rs2735383CC homozygote than those from the subjects with other genotypes (P = 0.0008). Our data suggested that the rs2735383G>C variation contributes to an increased risk of lung cancer by diminishing gene's expression through binding of microRNA-629 to the polymorphic site in the 3'-UTR of NBS1 gene.

Among the cell lines we examined, Hep3B cells stably expressing miR122 (Hep3B/miR122) exhibited a significant enhancement of HCVcc propagation. Surprisingly, the productions of infectious particles in Hep3B/miR122 cells upon infection with HCVcc were comparable to those in Huh7 cells. Furthermore, a line of "cured" cells established by elimination of HCV RNA from the Hep3B/miR122 replicon cells exhibited an enhanced expression of miR122 and a continuous increase of infectious titers of HCVcc in every passage.

6764	hsa-mir-21	Colorectal Neoplasms	22120473	Increased expression of miR-21, mir-135a and miR-335 was associated with clinical progression of CRC (colorectal cancer), while miR-206 demonstrated an opposite trend. The levels of mir-21 did not associate with the expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor in CRC and one of many putative targets of miR-21, but interestingly was associated with stage of disease in the PTEN expressing tumours. Surprisingly, let7a, a KRAS-targeting miR, showed elevated expression in metastatic disease compared to normal mucosa or non-metastatic disease, and only in KRAS mutation positive tumors.

Moreover, high miR-21 expression was found to be correlated with Breslow thickness and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high microRNA-21 expression showed shorter 5-year disease-free or overall survival than those with low microRNA-21 expression. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of microRNA-21 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients. Antisense-mediated microRNA-21 inhibition could significantly suppress growth, increase apoptosis and enhance chemo- or radiosensitivity of human cutaneous melanoma cells by inducing the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Thus, the status of microRNA-21 might be an independent prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma, and microRNA-21 has the potential of being a novel molecular target for the treatment of human cutaneous melanoma.

7004	hsa-mir-122	Hepatitis C	22189820	Here we show that HCV IRES-dependent translation efficiency in the hepatoma cell line Huh7 is highest during the G 0 and G 1 phases of the cell cycle but significantly drops during the S phase and even more in the G 2/M phase. The superimposed stimulation of HCV translation by ectopic miR-122 works best during the G 0, G 1 and G 2/M phases but is lower during the S phase. However, the levels of Ago2 protein do not substantially change during cell cycle phases, indicating that other cellular factors involved in HCV translation stimulation by miR-122 may be differentially expressed in different cell cycle phases. Moreover, the levels of endogenously expressed miR-122 in Huh7 cells are lowest in the S phase, indicating that the predominant G 0/G 1 state of non-dividing hepatocytes in the liver facilitates high expression of the HCV genome and stimulation by miR-122, with yet unknown factors involved in the differential extent of stimulation by miR-122.

The effects of the two polymorphic variants on cisplatin sensitivity were determined by clonogenic assay. The overexpression of AP-2α with mutant 3' UTR (C allele) in the endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1A, which has high levels of endogenous miR-200b/200c/429 and low levels of AP-2α protein, significantly increased cisplatin sensitivity, but overexpression of A allele of AP-2α has no significant effects, compared with mock transfection. We concluded that miR-200b/200c/429 induced cisplatin resistance by repressing AP-2α expression in endometrial cancer cells. The SNP (rs1045385) A>C variation decreased the binding of miR-200b/200c/429 to the 3' UTR of AP-2α, which upregulated AP-2α protein expression and increased cisplatin sensitivity. Our results suggest that SNP (rs1045385) may be a potential prognostic marker for cisplatin treatment.
